# Polymer Contacts API sample

This is a Google Contacts API(https://developers.google.com/google-apps/contacts/v3) sample using Polymer(https://www.polymer-project.org/) components only.

# Sample Limitation

This sample will only work as http://localhost on port 80 (clientId limitation).
Update the clientId to your own one to bypass this limitation (you can get one in the Google Developers Console).

#  Included google-signin modifications

The google-signin component found in this sample was only updated to use polymer-project.org files, nothing else is changed.
